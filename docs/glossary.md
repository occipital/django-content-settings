# Glossary

Some of the terms used in other articles are explained here. The terms from the glossary are shown in *italic* in the other articles.

In order to better understand these terms, I'll use the following example.

```python
FAVORITE_SUBJECTS = SimpleStringsList(
    "mysubject",
    comment_starts_with="//",
    help="my favorite songs subjects"
)
```

### admin preview

*or setting admin preview*

When the admin changes the *raw value* in Django Admin, the admin panel shows a preview that somehow illustrates the *value*. Sometimes, it is tricky when you need to show a value of *callable type*.

### callable type

When the *setting value* is callable, so in code you need to call the value, for example `content_settings.FAVORITE_SUBJECTS()`. Most of the *callable types* can be found in `content_settings.types.template`.

### content tags

Tags for the setting generated by the value of the setting.

### db value

*or setting db value*

*Raw value* that is stored in the database.

### default value

*or setting default value*

`"mysubject"` - *raw value* that will be used for database initialization or for cases when *db value* is not set.

### definition

*or setting definition*

The example above shows the full setting definition. Includes *name* and *type definition*.

### django settings

As we use settings to refer to content settings, we will use django settings for actual Django settings constants.

### instance

*or setting instance*

The result of calling the *type definition*. The instance is responsible for converting, parsing, and validating processes.

### JSON value

*or setting JSON value*

JSON representation of the *value* for API. Generated by `json_view_value` of the *instance*.

### lazy value

*or setting lazy value*

*Use setting* with *prefix* that returns *value* as a lazy object. Can be useful when you need to save a reference to the *value* in a global environment before the *python object* generation. Example: `content_settings.lazy__FAVORITE_SUBJECTS`. Generated by `lazy_give` of the *instance*, see also `content_settings.types.lazy`.

### mixin

*or setting mixin*

In the *setting definition*, you can extend *setting type* with a list of mixins using the `mixin` function (the function and most of the available mixins can be found in `content_settings.types.mixins`). Example: `DAYS_WITHOUT_FAIL = mix(MinMaxValidationMixin, SimpleInt)("5", min_value=0, max_value=10, help="How many days without fail")` - *type* `SimpleInt` was extended with the mixin `MinMaxValidationMixin`, which adds new optional attributes `min_value` and `max_value` and validates if the *python object* is within a given range.

### name

*or setting name*

`FAVORITE_SUBJECTS` - the unique name of your setting. Should always be uppercased. By the same name, you can *use setting* and change it in Django Admin.

### prefix

*or setting prefix*

A content setting method that can return something other than *setting value*. For example, `content_settings.lazy__FAVORITE_SUBJECTS` - `lazy` is a prefix and the whole *use* returns the *lazy value* of the setting `FAVORITE_SUBJECTS`. The `register_prefix` allows new prefix registration.

### python object

*or setting python object or py object*

The object generated by converting the raw value when starting the server (or when the raw value is changed). Generated by the method `to_python` of the *setting instance*.

### raw value

*or setting raw value*

The initial value, always a string. This value is parsed/converted using the *setting instance*.

### suffix

*or setting suffix*

An extra attribute that extends the `give` method that returns *value*. For example, `content_settings.FAVORITE_SUBJECTS__first` - `first` is a *suffix*. Suffixes are convenient for cases when you need to extract some other data from the *python object*, not only the *value*, or you need to return *value* in a different way for special cases.

### type

*or setting type*

`SimpleStringsList` - All of the built-in classes can be found in `content_settings.types`.

### type arguments

*or setting type arguments*

`comment_starts_with="//", help="my favorite songs subjects"`.

### type definition

*or setting type definition*

`SimpleStringsList("mysubject", comment_starts_with="//", help="my favorite songs subjects")`.

### use setting

*or setting use*

When you use a setting in the Python code `content_settings.FAVORITE_SUBJECTS` or in a template `{{CONTENT_SETTINGS.FAVORITE_SUBJECTS}}`. All of these code examples return the *setting value*.

### user defined types

Types that are allowed to be used for user-defined settings. [More about it here](uservar.md).

### user defined settings

Settings that are created in Django Admin by the user (not by code). [More about it here](uservar.md).

### value

*or setting value*

The value that will be returned when you *use setting*. Generated by the `give` method for the *setting instance* for each *use*. For the most basic types, *value* is the same as the *python object*.
