## How to setup cs_test project

For testing and checking front-end part of the project we have cs_test project/folder

After setting up the env you need `make cs-test-migrate` to create a db for the project, then you can `make cs-test` to start local runserver with content settings configured or `make cs-test-shell` to access to shell of the content settings.

### Docker container to test different backends

To test and adjusts MySQL backend we have docker compose file for current cs_test project. To built it use `make cs-test-docker-build` and `make cs-test-docker-up` to start. Feel free to adjust docker for your needs and tests.

## When you update documentation

Creating good documentation is hard, and there is always room for making it better. I would really appreciate you help here, but don't forget a couple of things:

* make sure using terms from our [Glossary](glossary.md), as the system itself introduce a lot of new terms
* when you update doc strings (documentation inside py-files), do `make mdsource` to collect it in [source.md](source.md)

## Tests

It is important not only creating test for new functionality or new code, but also improve tests for already written functionality. So it is good to have just new tests in a pull-request.

For creating tests we use the following modules:

```
pytest = "^7.4.3"
pytest-mock = "^3.12.0"
pytest-django = "^4.7.0"
django-webtest = "^1.9.11"
pytest-cov = "^4.1.0"
nox = "^2023.4.22"
```

Some of the make-commands that we have already can make your testing process more confortable:

* `make test` just run all of the tests in current poetry env
* `make test-full` run tests with extended settings
* `make test-min` run tests with settings that limits functionality
* `make test-cov` to check the corrent test covarage
* `make test-cov-xml` generate test covarage in `cov.xml` which can me later used for seing places with no tests
* `make test-nox` (will be long) - running tests under all supported python versions and Django versions
* `make test-nox-oldest` - just run all of the tests under the oldes combination
