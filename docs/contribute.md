## How to Set Up the `cs_test` Project

The `cs_test` project/folder is used for testing and verifying the front-end portion of the project.

1. After setting up the environment, run:

   make cs-test-migrate
   ```
   This creates a database for the project.

2. To start a local runserver with content settings configured:
   ```bash
   make cs-test
   ```

3. To access the content settings shell:
   ```bash
   make cs-test-shell

### Docker Container for Testing Different Backends

To test and adjust the MySQL backend, a Docker Compose file is included for the current `cs_test` project.

- Build the Docker container:
  ```bash
  make cs-test-docker-build
  ```

- Start the container:
  ```bash
  make cs-test-docker-up
  ```

Feel free to modify the Docker setup to suit your testing needs.

## When Updating Documentation

Creating high-quality documentation is challenging, and improvements are always welcome! If youâ€™re contributing to documentation, please keep the following in mind:

- Use terms consistently from the [Glossary](glossary.md), as the system introduces many new concepts.
- If you update docstrings (documentation inside Python files), run:
  ```bash
  make mdsource
  ```
  This collects the updated docstrings into [source.md](source.md).
